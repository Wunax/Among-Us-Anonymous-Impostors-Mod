# Anonymous Impostors Mod

Anonymous Impostors is a mod for Among Us that allows to make impostors anonymous to each other. Therefore impostors can accidentally kill each other.\
The mod also adds a option to force imposters to win solo.

## Installation

1. Download the latest build of BepInEx Unity IL2CPP for Windows __**x86**__ machines available [here](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be).
2. Download the latest version of the mod available [here](https://github.com/Wunax/among-us-anonymous-impostors-mod/releases/latest).
3. **Optionnal**: Create a backup of your Among Us game folder (`Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us`).
4. Extract the content of the BepInEx Unity IL2CPP archive to your Among Us game folder (where your `Among Us.exe` is located).
5. Extract the content of the mod archive to your Among Us game folder (where your `Among Us.exe` is located).
6. Start your game as usual.

## Usage

In the lobby the host can enable anonymous impostors with the command `/anonymous on|off` in the chat or directly in the lobby settings.\
The option to force impostors to win solo is available with the command `/soloimpostors on|off` or also in the lobby settings (**Note**: This option does not work if anonymous impostors are not enabled).

## FAQ

### How can I remove or disable the mod?
Delete or remove the next file from the folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us\BepInEx\plugins\AnonymousImpostorsMod.dll`
### Can we play on official servers with this mod?
Currently there are no checks on the Innersloth servers, so you can play privately with your friends on the official servers. **Please do not use it in public online matches.**\
In case Innersloth implements server-side checks, I recommend that you take a look at private servers like [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor).
### Does everyone have to install the mod in the lobby?
Yes everyone has to install it.
### Can we play with crewlink?
Yes.
